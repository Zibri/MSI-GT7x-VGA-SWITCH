# MSI-GT7x-VGA-SWITCH
Selects VGA from LINUX or EFI!

These programs or batch scripts will let you swtch the VGA from INTEL to NVIDIA (or the opposite)

This is possible at the moment only from Windows (bad choice MSI!).

Now it will also be possible from Linux or directly from an EFI SHELL!

intel.nsh and nvidia.nsh are two EFI Shell scripts that can be run directly from EFI shell.

Just "make intel"  and "make nvidia" to compile the 2 C sources.

A reboot is needed afterwards because the VGA is switched by BIOS at boot time.

Enjoy!
(and write me a line if you use these)
